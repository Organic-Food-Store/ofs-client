### Setup

##### Prerequisites

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

	npm install -g bower
    npm install -g polymer-cli

##### Make a clone of the project on your machine

    git clone https://github.com/Organic-Food-Store/ofs-client
    

### Start the server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve --open
