# Polymer App Toolbox - Starter Kit


### Migrating from Polymer Starter Kit v1?

[Check out our blog post that covers what's changed in PSK2 and how to migrate!](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/2016-08-18-polymer-starter-kit-or-polymer-cli.html)

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

	npm install -g bower
    npm install -g polymer-cli

##### Make a clone of the project on your machine

    git clone https://github.com/Organic-Food-Store/ofs-client
    

### Start the server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve --open
